Reporting a bug in FontForge is easy, thanks to GitHub. Here's how:

* Visit [Github.com](http://www.github.com) and create an account
* Go to the FontForge Github Project Page, [github.com/fontforge/fontforge](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/), and click the 'Issues' sidebar link
* Click the big green 'New issue' button on the top right
* Enter the title and description of your issue and submit it

The FontForge developer community will then discuss your issue and resolve it.
