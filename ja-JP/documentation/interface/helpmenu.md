#### Help

Invokes a browser and brings up contextual help on fontforge web site.

If you define the environment variable [BROWSER](../cliargs/#BROWSER)
so that it contains the name of the browser you like then FontForge will
use that, otherwise it will try to guess something appropriate by
looking at your PATH. On CygWin systems browsers that work in the
windows world (as opposed to the cygwin sub-system) must be specified by
a full path spec.

FontForge will search for help in either /usr/share/doc/fontforge/ or on
http://fontforge.sf.net/.
