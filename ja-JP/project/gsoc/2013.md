#### Describe your organization

FontForge is a loosely organized free software font editor project. The C codebase is on GitHub and actively developed by a community of volunteers.

#### Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code 2013? What do you hope to gain by participating?

FontForge has a lot of powerful functionality under the hood, but the user interface sucks. We hope font design is an interesting nexus of technology and design for students interested in UX-centered development, and from participating in GSOC FontForge will gain a better interface in various areas.

#### Has your organization participated in past Google Summer of Codes? (yes/no)

No.

#### If you answered “yes” to the question above, please summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your participation. Please also list your pass/fail rate for each year.

N/A

#### If your organization has not previously participated in Google Summer of Code, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?

No.

#### What Open Source Initiative approved license(s) does your project use?

MIT and GPLv3

#### What is the URL for your Ideas list? **This is the most important part of your proposal. Please make sure we can access it and it is complete when you submit this proposal. “Placeholder” or inaccessible ideas pages will be grounds for an automatic rejection for participation in Google Summer of Code 2013.**

Here are some proposed ideas:

* Add UI for class based metrics (Impallari method)
* Improve UI for class based kerning (OpenType classes)
* Improve UI for OpenType feature development
* Add UI for interpolating glyphs (similar to Simplepolator)
* Add UI for interpolating fonts (similar to Superpolator, Glyphs, etc)
* Add UI for diffing fonts (no parallels)

TODO: Set up a GitHub Issue Tracker tag for these after they are fleshed out

[fontforge-devel@lists.sourceforge.net](http://fontforge.10959.n7.nabble.com/Developer-f3.html)
